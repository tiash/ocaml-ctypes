    The argument [?from], if supplied, is a library handle returned by
    {!Dl.dlopen}.

    The argument [?stub], if [true] (defaults to [false]), indicates that the

    an OCaml value that raises an exception when called.

    The value [?check_errno], which defaults to [false], indicates whether
    {!Unix.Unix_error} should be raised if the C function modifies [errno].
    Please note that a function that succeeds is allowed to change errno. So
    use this option with caution.

    The value [?release_runtime_lock], which defaults to [false], indicates
    whether the OCaml runtime lock should be released during the call to the C
    function, allowing other threads to run.  If the runtime lock is released
    then the C function must not access OCaml heap objects, such as arguments
    passed using {!Ctypes.ocaml_string} and {!Ctypes.ocaml_bytes}, and must not
    call back into OCaml.

(** Construct a function pointer type from a function type.

    ----
    This function hides hard to reason about details of the life-time of the ocaml closure
    and C function pointer. Getting this wrong will cause hard to debug segmentation faults.

    For passing ocaml functions into C (for use in callbacks) consider using
    [Foreign.Make_funptr(val (funptr_spec ...))].

    If passing function pointers from C consider using [Ctypes.static_funptr] and
    [Foreign.call_static_funptr].
    ----

    The ctypes library, like C itself, distinguishes functions and function
    pointers.  Functions are not first class: it is not possible to use them
    as arguments or return values of calls, or store them in addressable
    memory.  Function pointers are first class, and so have none of these
    restrictions.

    The value [?check_errno], which defaults to [false], indicates whether
    {!Unix.Unix_error} should be raised if the C function modifies [errno].

    The value [?runtime_lock], which defaults to [false], indicates whether
    the OCaml runtime lock should be released during the call to the C
    function, allowing other threads to run.  If the runtime lock is released
    then the C function must not access OCaml heap objects, such as arguments
    passed using {!Ctypes.ocaml_string} and {!Ctypes.ocaml_bytes}, and must
    not call back into OCaml.  If the function pointer is used to call into
    OCaml from C then the [?runtime_lock] argument indicates whether the lock
    should be acquired and held during the call.

      Failure to call [free] and not holding a reference this this pointer
      is an error. To avoid unexpected crashes we log this and ensure that
      potentially still needed ocaml values are retained.

      For many use cases it may be simpler to use [with_fun] instead as this will
      do the free for you. *)

      This will automatically call [free fptr] after [DO_STUFF] completes.

      It is not safe to use if the C function ptr [fptr] may still be used
      after [DO_STUFF] completed.
